## What am I doing _now_?

- Preparing for a new year with a concentration on my mental and physical health, building community, and improving my communication skills.
- Working on chord melodies for Autumn Leaves, All of Me, and whatever else strikes my fancy on Mandolin.
- Playing around with embedded test automation using my Rigol Scope
- Getting back into skiing, ice climbing, and rock climbing in the gym.
- More motors!

### My priorities are:

- Cultivating a meditation, fitness and journaling practice.
- Making music, and art.
