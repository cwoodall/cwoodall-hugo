## What am I doing _now_?

- Working on electric aircraft at [BETA Technologies](beta.team)
- Skiing!
- Playing around with note taking in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
- Learning a little [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) each day.

### My priorities are:

- Building strong habits around going to sleep, waking up, doing deep work, and building new skills

### Quotes On My Mind

> Only ideas won by walking have any value
>
> -- [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fs.blog/2014/05/a-philosophy-of-walking/)

> Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes — train and sprint, then rest and reassess.
> -- [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/873624849230385152?lang=en)

> The Buddha told his disciples, “Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.” I say the same to you—you must assume the responsibility for what you believe.
> -- Richard Hamming, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn
