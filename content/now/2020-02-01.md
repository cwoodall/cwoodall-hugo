## What am I doing _now_?

Reflecting on 2019, it was a crazy year with a lot to learn on a personal level.

I am now in Burlington, VT working at BETA Technologies on the future of electric aviation! My main focus is on inverters for controlling motors. This is taking up most of my time.

I have been meditating daily (using a combination of Unified Mindfulness and Sam Harris' Waking Up app), trying to do daily creative acts (water colors, music, programming, etc), and when I can going to yoga. Climbing has taken a little bit of a back seat at the moment, but I want to set some good goals to drive forward my climbing performance. I have realized how deep and meaningful climbing is to me. One of my biggest goals right now is preparing for a 10 day mediation retreat.

### My priorities are:

- Learning all I can about motors!
- Getting on a few WI4's before the ice season ends!


### Quotes On My Mind

and

> Contemplate the marvel that is existence, and rejoice that you are able to do so. I feel I have the right to tell you this because as I am inscribing these words, I am doing the same.
