[_Test Driven Development for Embedded C_](http://amzn.to/2e2lBTn) by [James Grenning](http://blog.wingman-sw.com/) is a book I heard about through a friend of mine, as well as, through the
[embedded.fm](http://embedded.fm/) embedded systems podcast. It is a well thought
out introduction to TDD in an environment where there is a strong reluctance to
adopt new techniques, and improve code readability, provability and test-ability.
Grenning does a great job at making the sale that TDD is ultimately worth it and
then executes through examples how to test code from scratch, how to add test harnessing
to legacy code, and ultimately how to design code so that it can be tested. To developers
who don't work with C for an embedded platform you might thing this is old hat; however,
for me this book changed the way I think not only of writing C for embedded systems,
but all code. Unit testing has become a standard part of my vocabulary and what I value
in code.
