Humans are story-tellers, we communicated by telling others about our 
experiences, about those of others, and most interestingly about things
that never even happened. These stories create a shared network of 
knowledge and information, which allow us to cooperate and form networks
of trust, and eventually layer on top of each other to form concepts like
money, religion and the nation-state. _[Sapiens]_ by [Yuval Noah Harari] 
explores and reveals pieces of the story telling nature of humanity and 
reveals the good and the bad of this. On one hand it is how we are able
to cooperate and solve some big world problems; but on the other hand it
is the reason we have those problems and why we can execute large 
displays of evil and inhumanity. _[Sapiens]_ really is a book that makes
you see the world in a different way and also it helped me deal with 
some of the shared human delusions like money. Just because it is a 
delusion doesn't make it any less real, humans use these abstract ideas
to form a basis of how they should interact and thus makes them necessary
parts of our life. They may be more fluid than the laws of physics, but
they are in many ways no less important.
