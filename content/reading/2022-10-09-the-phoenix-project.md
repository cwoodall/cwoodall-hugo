[The Phoenix Project] has been recommended to me by a lot of people over the years. As a book about DevOps in an IT  industry a little detached from my current work in motor controls, and software, for electric aviation, I was a little concerned that I might not find a lot that was useful for me; however, the journey [The Phoenix Project] takes you on was far too familiar, and while the specific solutions might not apply the core of **The Three Ways**, looking at engineering as plant management, and some of the realizations about how to align and work in a larger organization will certainly aid my in my career.

The core of the book follows a story where Bill becomes promoted to a position as the VP of IT in his organization, and finds that the whole IT organization is in disarray. After a few hard outages, failed projects, and losing the company tons of money; Bill, with the assistance of Erik Reid (who provides sagely advice), is able to right the ship, gain a new view of what work is, and improve his organization. Overall, the main thread of the story involves finding your bottlenecks and relieving them, controlling the flow of work, aligning that flow of work with the business goals, and continuous improvement of business processes. This then also leads into a concept of DevOps, where the development and operations side of an organization work together to increase release cycles, test cycles, and requirements discovery cycles. This then allows for the development team to release faster and converge on more useful solutions faster, and the operations team to support the end product better, improve reliability and find optimizations that can improve efficiency across an entire organization.

### The Three Ways

1. Make the work visible, control the flow of work, align yourself with the business goals and the customer goals, prevent defects from moving downstream. The first way is all about left to right flow (business to customer), improving the speed at which ideas can make their way to the customer. The result of this is CI/CD systems, and systems that can be changed.
2. The second way increases feedback in every stage of the process, allowing for increased communication, and making issues visible as soon as possible
3. The third way is about continuous improvement of the entire organization. This is about improving processes, automation, increasing efficiency, launching projects that can reduce bottlenecks and increase throughput. This allows for a more generative, creative, and risk-taking culture, supported by the other ways.


### The Types of Work

Another take away for me was the types of work:

1. Direct Value Work/Business Work
2. Internal Projects
3. Changes and Support
4. Unplanned Work

Of all of these the only one that is of dubious value, or is unnecessarily expensive is unplanned work. Unplanned work adds chaos to the system, since unplanned work is by definition not visible, it creates delays and issues throughout an entire organization. The other issues is that your bottlenecks often will be implicitly involved in unplanned work, further increasing delays. It is clear to me that unplanned work is the beginning of the doom spiral for an organization.
