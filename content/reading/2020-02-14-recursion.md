[Recursion] by [Blake Crouch] is an interesting take on a time travel thriller, involving characters and relationships across multiple time lines. 
It is interesting how some of the characters who at first seem minor become integral parts of the story, developing into more interesting and 
intelligent characters over their recursions, creating small perturbations leading to different lives, but infrequently to different outcomes.
What does it mean to try to change the present by going into the past? Especially when everyone immediately recollects all relevant timelines
once the moment the timelines diverged occurs.

Recursion also points out that sometimes we can try to play god, become obsessive, and entirely miss the point. That what we want can completely
derail us from getting the love, happiness, and satisfaction that we thought it would give us. Sometimes you need to go back to the root of the 
problem, to before any decisions were made, and fundamentally change the path your life is on.
