Recently I started playing bass guitar and working some [music](/music) after a long period of not working on music too much. I was listening to [Them Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCd_ERZvZM) by Thundercat and became somewhat curious about the "wah"/envelope follower effect that he uses heavily throughout the song. This effect is pretty standard in funk, and other genres. However, I became interested in how the effect is implemented and decided to throw together an audio development environment in Python and implement this for myself.
