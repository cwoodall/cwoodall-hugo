## Origin

Me and my fiance (Emily) have been riding our bikes a lot more. I have had a great start to my season with
a lot of early season days on my hardtail (Banshee Paradox), and a really fun "race/ride" at the Mix Tape race
in Freetown, MA. Emily has been building up too and we wanted to get out together on a multi day trip. For me
this is something I have been interested in since I bought my Surly CrossCheck in 2018; but I had never actually
done. Usually climbing trips, work, family obligations all get in the way; so this year I decided it was best to
de-prioritize climbing and prioritize cycling... well gravel riding and mountain biking at least. On Jan 1, 2025
I signed up for the Vermont Overland Race (August) and the Mix Tape race (April) as commitments to myself to
lock in on biking this year. There is only time for so many things in a given year and I find that I like to drink
deeply from whatever it is I am pursuing at the time.

With this in mind, I had been planning a bikepacking overnight trip going from Arlington to Salem and then Salem 
to Rockport using the MBTA to come back with camping near Salem; but wanted to do a shakeout ride a few weeks
earlier that wouldn't include camping. Me and Emily had also been fascinated by the ability to use trains to facilitate
different bike trips that may otherwise be too long, or to tedious to do without a car. Our preferred style of riding
is a mix of gravel, country roads, paths, fireroads/double track and singletrack; we are not a big fan of pure road riding.
With this in mind I started to look for ways and places to use the MBTA to give us a good overnighter (with a hotel stay)
that would let us dip our toes into bikepacking without having to worry about tents and sleep systems.

## The Route

When I started looking I had a few thoughts in mind:

- The Mid State Trail (mostly not well maintained for the type of cycling we were going to do); because it had shelters along the route.
- Rutland State Forest/Ware River Rail Trail
- Mass Central Rail Trail.

At first glance these seemed really far away to get to without a car; but on second glance it turned out that Wachusett Station (end of the Fitchburg) line was
within a ~15 mile ride of Rutland State Forest. From there it came to finding a place to stay. This region of MA is actually pretty low
on services, there are lots of houses and properties but not much in the way of food, hotels, etc. However, we had been the Barre, MA for
the NEMBA Barre Awesome Ride, and this is at a logical connection to Rutland State Forest and not far off from the Mass Central Rail Trail.
Luckily we were able to find a good place to stay in Barre, and we also heard good things about the Stone Cow Brewery in Barre. So we chose this
for our over night.

Originally we intended to camp, so we had been looking at hip camp, and also the midstate trail shelters to find a good place to camp (and Pout and Trout), but
we decided to take the pressure off to improve the probability of an enjoyable late April/early May trip.

After that it was just a matter of choosing how to get back, for that we routed out the Mass Central Rail Trail and down to Worcester which allowed us to visit Emily's Family.

## Day 1: Wachusett Station (Fitchburg Line) to Barre, MA

On Day 1 we woke up at 6AM, made a big breakfast of eggs, lox and yogurt and got on our bikes to catch an 8am train from Belmont Station. This was a bit hectic because
me and Emily were routing to two different rail stations; but luckily the two rail stations were along the same route so our miscommunication was met with the convenience of
being able to stop earlier than originally anticipated. Once we got on the train we found ourselves on a rail car with 4 other bikes, which left little to no room for our bikes. We were allowed to stand with our bikes for a little while, and then eventually we were able to find space for them.

We got to Wachusett station around 9:45 am and started our ride. This section of the ride I was worried would have some harrowing roads, but it was mostly peaceful country roads, very few cars and good views.

We routed to Wachusett mountain where there was a nice gravel road to go on (Balance Rock Road) that we took up and across the mountain and then down the North Road to get to a nice set of gravel on the other side. This then left us stitching through some lovely gravel, dirt and paved country roads out to a section of single track along the mid state trail.

At this point, it was getting towards lunch time and we still had many miles ahead of us, so we stopped at Pout and Trout, at this point the weather kind of fluctuated between pleasant and windy/threatening to rain. We ate a good lunch of Tuna fish packets and cheese sticks and were on our way to the prison camp roads in Rutland State Forest.

Rutland State Forest is amazing for gravel riding, I highly recommend it for anyone who is really into it, I will say that it has some chunky sections so the wider tires you got the more comfy the ride will be; but it was mostly non technical riding. There are some cool old buildings around that are fun. This lead us up to Barre Falls Dam, which was in a way gorgeous, it just was a unique looking place for MA in my opinion. This route eventually lead us to an unintended creek crossing. This added to the adventure value. Luckily I packed a pair of sandals so was able to put them on and safely ferry the bikes across the water.

After this it was beautiful all the way to Barre with one cruel climb to end the day.

We got to the Inn, showered then went out to the Stone Cow Brewery which had awesome food, awesome beer, and amazing ice cream. Though there was a crazy deluge while we were there.

## Day 2: Barre, MA to Worcester, MA

Day 2 started with a lovely breakfast, some stretching and working our way over to the Mass Central Rail Trail. The Mass Central Rail Trail was smooth and easy going, a big change from the navigational and terrain challenges of our first day; and we even ran into some family along the way. We were making great time, but then we got to a section were we decided to try to cut straight through rather than follow the roads suggested on the Mass Central Rail Trail signs. We were greated by some rougher terrain, down trees but clear evidence of others passage... Then we hit a swamp, and then the trial petered out and we needed to cross a water gap with a single wooden beam across it. And finally we had to do a second creek crossing (3 water crossings done out of our 0 planned crossings).

At this point we just continue down the Mass Central Rail Trail as Marked and worked our way to WOrcester to visit some family and catch the MBTA from Union Station in WOrcester. I was worried about biking through Worcester, but it was pretty much abandoned on Sunday afternoon and we had a bike line or really easy streets as we came into the city from the north.

## Reflection

This trip was awesome, in reflection it was empowering to pack up the bags and go. It was amazing to not be able to use a car and have a grand adventure. I was taken aback by the beauty of this region of MA. I have really just not explored it even though it is fairly close. i have been to Crow Hill to climb many times, same with Farley Ledges, but this region, in between those two areas, offered some amazing views, big meadows, surpisingly expansive vistas, and tons of beautiful forest, streams and little bits of decaying industry. 

Both me and Emily found it empowering to be able to have so little stuff with us and to just be exploring, on adventure, happily living in the moment. Even with the emotional ups and downs of navigating, talking about life and the world, I was happy. Getting home, unloading the bikes and being done with unpacking was so easy. It is often we load up the car to go on a climbing or mountain biking trip, with a lot of camping equipment; or extra clothes just incase we want to do something else. On this trip we were committed to one course of action, had tons of time to relax and the simplicity was truely empowering. I will be planning more MBTA and train powered overnights in the future!
