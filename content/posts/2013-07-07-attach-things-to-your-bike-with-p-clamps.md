A nice and simple hack for attaching things onto bikes without dropping a ton of money.
Before you buy your P-Clamps, or Rubber Coated Metal Clamps, make sure to measure the
diameter of the tube on your bike you want to attach the clamp to. You can get them from
[Grainger](http://www.grainger.com/Grainger/ecatalog/N-1z0dvfc) and
[McMaster-Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/), but they are also easily found in your local
hardware store.
