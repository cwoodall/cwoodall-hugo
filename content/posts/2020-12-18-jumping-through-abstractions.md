One of the greatest skills I try my best to practice consistently is the ability to jump through different layers of abstractions.

There are times in my life when I am better or worse at this, but I do think it is one of those META skills that can really make life better. 
In retrospect I had been doing this my whole life, but I think it really clicked during my undergraduate education as an Electrical Engineer
somewhere between circuit theory and digital signal processing. The core of both of these courses is really just "let's analyze differential
equations" and what you soon learn is that you can take all that first order physics, add a few constraints and simplifications and make
problems MUCH easier to solve. This then extends to computer simulation, etc (though you can use somewhat more complex abstractions here,
but they are still simulations not reality!). This is incredible because what it means is if you can bound a problem, and the physical 
realities that the end result is subject to you can do a lot of really great and fast engineering work. However, this all breaks down 
in the real world at different points. To stick with the analogy, what if your little widget gets submerged, or is not used as intended,
or is start up in a funny state, or is subject to cosmic rays!

The power is not in hopelessly going, oh dear my abstraction no longer works! It is understanding the VALUE that abstraction gave you
then being able to adapt and jump to a new abstraction to solve your specific problem. This sort of iterative abstraction approach 
allows you to seemlessly move up and down the abstraction ladder (and side to side) to solve problems and do so reasonably fast. These
abstractions sit upon scientific literature, pedagogy and a bit of curmudgeonly wisdom, but often the hardest thing to do is know that
today you are holding a hammer and you are looking at a screw not a nail!

Systems approach, but not too much!

One thing I have found harder as I grow older is that I can almost get stuck on abstractions sometimes. I think this starts to happen when
society, or some part of you, says hey I am pretty good at this! I am an expert now! Or I am a true master, or even I am a journeyman. You
become very focused on that one tool, that one abstraction, or toolkit... You are like a carpenter who has forgotten he has anything other
than a hammer and saw. Or even worse you are a carpenter who has forgotten that a machinist working with metal is a useful ally in 
achieving your goals! 

Beginners mind, keep learning new abstractions, develop expertise but stay a beginner. Keep taking on new views. I think this is one  of the only 
ways to grrow
