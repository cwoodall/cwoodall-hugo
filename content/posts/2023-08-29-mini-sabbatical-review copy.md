During the summer of 2023 I took 3 months off from June to September between two jobs. I found that my time at BETA had left me a little exhausted, and in need of a change of pace and setting that bouncing immediately from one job to the other would not fully accomplish. My future employer was willing to put off my start date to the beginning of September, and off I went for a few months.

The initial temptation was to go and do something big and impressive, some big climbing objective or impressive bit of travel (Peru in this case). However, the more I looked into myself, what I really wanted to do was:

- Visit friends and family
- Find some time to work on personal projects and writing
- Get outside and climb a lot
- Be in a few different locations for times through the summer
- Relocate from Burlington, VT to the Boston area
- Spend time with my partner, and adjust to living together and in Arlington, MA

So I scheduled my summer around these activities and this honestly has included a fair bit of travel, some more domestic activities (decorating, moving, organizing, cooking and cleaning), lots of climbing, and re-engaging old and deep friendships with people I haven't seen in a while; but whose presence I have missed deeply in my life.

## Why?

Overall, the concept of mini-retirements came into my mind first by reading [Four Hour Work Week][four-hour] by [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog), which introduced the concept to me that instead of waiting until you are late in life to take retirement taking occasional longer breaks from work could be beneficial. This was coupled and re-enforced by other interviews and podcasts I have listened to over the years, as well as, books I have read. Make the most of your life, and take time to enjoy it. In reality I had worked through a very busy high school schedule, worked every summer (and winter break) through college, then worked straight through with 1-4 week breaks between jobs from 2014 until 2023. I was ready for a break to let my mind expand a little bit, and relax. Ultimately, the turning point came when my therapist pointed out that I had the means to take such a break and that the overall financial impact would likely be a small blip along my financial journey, and that the mental and physical health benefits would likely be worth it if I set the correct intentions along the way.


> The pathless path is an alternative to the default path. It is an embrace of uncertainty and discomfort. It’s a call to adventure in a world that tells us to conform. For me, it’s also a gentle reminder to laugh when things feel out of control and trusting that an uncertain future is not a problem to be solved.

## What's Next

I am starting a job as a Real-Time Controls Engineer at Commonwealth Fusion Systems. I will still be programming in C++ and Python, but my focus will be on control systems for Tokamak Operations. This is a change from my past roles which have all been explicitly in Embedded Software Engineering or Electrical Engineering. I have grown into a controls engineering role working at BETA implementing, tuning and designing motor controllers for PMSM motors. I am excited to continue to grow in this field and learn more about the physics and engineering of fusion reactors. 

I have been doing some arrangements for violin and mandolin and want to keep on doing that, and recording more music.

I want to have friends and family over routinely to have great conversations. I have found that even one evening chatting with friends is a remedy for so much stress and anxiety in my life.

I am planning on continuing investing time and energy into rock climbing. I have a few 5.10c/d projects on my list and want to bust through that barrier.

I want to continue to learn about mushrooms and foraging. I have found that be learning about mushrooms, and what to identify I am looking at the outdoors in completely new ways. Places I have gone many times to climb now have a whole ecology that is so interesting to learn about. I find it fun to see and identify things I have not seen before, and forage for the very limited set of mushrooms I know how to identify (Chanterelles); however this has been interesting to me.

I am planning on continuing to read, and write about what I read

I have commitment to improving my health

## Lessons Learnt

1. My anxiety is way reduced, my sleep is way better; however, this has I think less to do with work and more with a feeling of peace, hopefulness and a feeling of security about my place in the world. I think a key insight is to **get good sleep (8 hours as a target)**, and have strategies for coping with night time anxiety (reading, writing, meditation, etc.). For me night time yoga nidra meditations have been very useful.
2. I have a lot of energy, and I am excited to get back to work. I am excited to learn new things, and to be challenged in new ways. Keeping non-work projects, and focuses fresh seems to be a way to unlock a lot of energy. My work is important to me, but it is not mine in a lot of ways. We collaborate on work with our peers, having creative and athletic projects that allow you to grow that are self-driven is important for me to maintain a healthy amount of energy.
3. Weightloss doesn't come for free. I kept hoping that by changing circumstances with work my weight would start to decrease, and while the trend is down; just removing work did not reduce my weight. However, having a more active day to day life style and eating better food does help. Lasting change comes from lifestyle change and good habits not from massive shifts (most of the time).
4. Curiosity
5. Value growth over being
6. Planning is hard, and entering a mini-sabbatical without the fitness required to take on some of your bucket list items is hard. If I choose to take extended time off of work again I will likely do more work around choosing a few bigger objectives to hit and train for them; as well as, scheduling good time to relax, reset and reassess.
