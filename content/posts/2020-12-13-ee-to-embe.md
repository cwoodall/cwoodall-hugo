Inspiration: Andrew Giroux, Cullen, Willem, etc

Key areas: DSP, Control Systems, Sensor Conditioning, Communications, OS Theory/Real Time Operations, Interrupts, Wireless Comms... and so on and so forth. Tooling... autogenerating stuff? Architecture!!!

1. Story to set this up
2. Just keep learning: Play with simple things first, arduino, lots of sensors, open hardware is great... Find little test fixtures at companies to build using RaspPi's or arduinos, be creative... Give yourself excuses
3. Formality: Learn architecture (C4 style is useful!), read opinionated books and blog posts about software development, learn to TEST things. Become an architect of HW/SW systems!
4. Tools in the toolbox: This is some of the most important stuff to just understand, or be able to model. An intuitve understanding of signals, systems and how data is processed can be super useful. 
   COntrol SYstems, Modeling, DSP this is the good stuff!. Image processing and ML too! Learn how to do basic curve fitting/linear regressions, clustering, etc. Learn filtering, etc. These are the tools
   Aside: Why I kept playing with audio projects... Why music is a good analogy for Signals and Systems
5. Grow up: learn how to manage projects, get stuff done and trade-off between effort and time. You will never be done growing up until you are sipping pina coladas on the beach, so buckle up :P

Oh and don;t be a curmudgeon! 

Some additional useful tips:

- Work with your EEs closely! Try to work on interface documents together. Make sure you both understand the whole signal flow
- Work with your high level Software Engineers closely! same basic principle!

YOU ARE THE GLUE THAT HOLDS IT ALL TOGETHER!
