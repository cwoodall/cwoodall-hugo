During the summer of 2023 I took 3 months off from June to September between two jobs. I found that my time at BETA had left me a little exhausted, and in need of a change of pace and setting that bouncing immediately from one job to the other would not fully accomplish. My future employer was willing to put off my start date to the beginning of September, and off I went for a few months.

<!--more-->

The initial temptation was to go and do something big and impressive, some big climbing objective or impressive bit of travel (Peru in this case). However, the more I looked into myself, what I really wanted to do was:

- Visit friends and family
- Find some time to work on personal projects and writing
- Get outside and climb a lot
- Be in a few different locations for times through the summer
- Relocate from Burlington, VT to the Boston area
- Spend time with my partner, and adjust to living together and in Arlington, MA

So I scheduled my summer around these activities and this honestly has included a fair bit of travel, some more domestic activities (decorating, moving, organizing, cooking and cleaning), lots of climbing, and re-engaging old and deep friendships with people I haven't seen in a while; but whose presence I have missed deeply in my life.

## Why?

Overall, the concept of mini-retirements came into my mind first by reading [Four Hour Work Week][four-hour] by [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog), which introduced the concept to me that instead of waiting until you are late in life to take retirement taking occasional longer breaks from work could be beneficial. This was coupled and re-enforced by other interviews and podcasts I have listened to over the years, as well as, books I have read. Make the most of your life, and take time to enjoy it. In reality I had worked through a very busy high school schedule, worked every summer (and winter break) through college, then worked straight through with 1-4 week breaks between jobs from 2014 until 2023. I was ready for a break to let my mind expand a little bit, and relax. Ultimately, the turning point came when my therapist pointed out that I had the means to take such a break and that the overall financial impact would likely be a small blip along my financial journey, and that the mental and physical health benefits would likely be worth it if I set the correct intentions along the way.

> The pathless path is an alternative to the default path. It is an embrace of uncertainty and discomfort. It’s a call to adventure in a world that tells us to conform. For me, it’s also a gentle reminder to laugh when things feel out of control and trusting that an uncertain future is not a problem to be solved.

## Timeline

### June

The focus of June was travel, visiting family and spending time away from home on the west coast.

#### June 1, 2023: My last day at BETA

I finished up on June 1 and my co-workers gave me a great send off. I received this awesome vest. I will remember all of the great times at BETA and I really hope that they will succeed in the future. I really developed as an Embedded Software Engineer, and as a Motor Controls Engineer there. I learnt a lot about leadership, and myself along the way. I am grateful for the opportunity to work there, and for the people I got to work with.

My first destination after some more local farewells, and good food in Burlington was to head off to New York to visit my parents. I got a chance to explore some of the local mountain biking, which was amazing and right out the back door. I can't believe I never explored it before! Along the way I also met up with one of my cousins who is in medical school and has taken up climbing. I spent a lot of time hanging with the parents, and seeing my Oma.

I also got to see my brother play at Skinny Dennis in Brooklyn, which was a great time. This was restorative

#### Climbing at Hanging Mountain with Ian

On the way back to Burlington I stopped by [Hanging Mountain in Western Massachusetts](https://climbgneiss.org/hanging-mountain/) which is a recently opened crag managed by the [WMCC (Western Massachusetts Climbers Coalition)](https://climbgneiss.org). The climbing here was incredible and I highly recommend it.

#### Spending a Week in the Adirondacks with Ian

After a few days back home I went to the Adirondacks camping at the Sharp Bridge Campground. During this time I finally got to check out Crane Mountain, hike Allen Mountain and do some memorable climbing at Ragged Mountain and Tilman's Arete.

Overall this was a restorative time, with some brewery hopping involved. The hike of Allen Mountain was a challenge for me as it ended up being a very long day (around 20 miles). I definitely underestimated both the length and difficulty of the day. However, it was beautiful full of some wild strawberries, grouse and great views... It was also full of mud and wet slab.

#### Squamish Trip

I drove home and then headed straight onto a plane to Vancouver with my partner Emily and we spent a day hiking around town, going around Stanley Park, eating some good food, and assembling our dream climbing team!

| :--------------------------------------------------: |
| ![](/img/posts/2023-08-29-sabbatical/vancouver.jpeg) |


That night we drove up to Squamish and we settled into our amazing AirBnb and got on a bunch of classics: Cat Crack (5.7), Neat and Cool (5.10a), Quarryman (5.8), and a few other great climbs. I felt ready to do some longer climbs

The next day we did Spirit of Squamish (5.8), which brings you right up next to Shannon Falls.

The rest of the trip involved some rest days, pushing the grade up to 5.9. Exploring some new areas near Murrin Park (Splitsville)and generally I left the trip feeling strong, and excited to climb more. I first went to Squamish in 2015 and I have been back a few times. It is one of my favorite places and I feel so fortunate I was able to share it with some of the friends I made in Burlington.

I departed Vancouver straight for Washington

### July

#### Trip to Washington State

I visited with my friends Steph and Rob in the Seattle area (and Tim). We went climbing at Keechelus Ridge, where I got to climb a few sport routes at all grades including a 5.10c which I onsighted. I was feeling very strong. The next few days were filled with a lot of chilling out, hiking, paddle boarding, hanging out by lakes and helping out around the house and garden. I was also introduced to an awesome Chicken Biryani recipe.

Towards the end of my time in Washington we took Rob's RV down to Index, WA where we climbed a bunch of classics (Senior Citizens in Space, Godzilla, Rattletale). I was very proud to have led Godzilla at 5.9+ with some encouragement cleanly. This was definitely a test piece for me and a major milestone in my climbing comeback. In some ways I am starting to feel I am getting close to my peak again.

This time ended up being pure fun, enjoyment, and a lot of introspection too! I am so grateful to have such great friends.

#### Moving to Arlington, MA

For my next adventure I ended up moving from Burlington, VT to Arlington, MA with Emily. We packed everything up. Here is where I admit that I played a lot of Legend of Zelda TOK during this time... However, the move got done. We had a nice big breakfast with all the parents, and I belayed up a couch. I am so glad to have such supportive family, a great partner, and friends who were willing to lend a hand.

#### Hanging around and climbing in the North East

Over the next few weeks I concentrated on settling into life in Arlington:

- Some fun bike rides, biking pretty close to 10 mi a day at a minimum!
- Lots of mid week trips up to Merriam Woods, Rumney and Farley. This included starting to pick out a few projects to work on including Peer Pressure (5.10d), and some 5.10c/d at Farley.
- Exploring the Boston area on bike and on foot
- Learning to surf
- Setting up my apartment
- Learning to cook with, season and care for a wok

### August

#### A Trip to Colorado
I started of August with a trip to Colorado to visit my friends Tim, Tom and P. I got to spend a decent amount of time in the Boulder area, climbed in Eldorado Canyon, the South Platte. I also went to a C++ meetup which was an awesome re-introduction to the software engineering community.

When climbing we did:

- Rewritten to Rebuffat's Arete at Eldorado Canyon
- Some climbing at Devil's Head in the South Platte
- Some bouldering in the South Platte
- A bunch of single pitch climbs at the West Ridge in Eldorado Canyon getting the grade up to 5.9 on trad gear.

Overall I found the climbing fun and humbling, I need to get my multipitch speed and efficiency back up, and I need to get my climbing headgame together.

| :--------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |

#### Back in Arlington

After Colorado I spent more time settling into the apartment, reading some papers on the SPARC reactor and Tokamak Fusion Controls, and generally enjoying life in Arlington. For a good overview of Tokamak Fusion Controls (and in this case Reinforcement Learning as the control law) recommend watching ["Jonas Buchli & Federico Felici: Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas with deep reinforcement learning"](Jonas Buchli & Federico Felici: Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas with deep reinforcement learning).

I also started practicing the Mandolin more regularly again and put together an [arrangement of "Rise"](https://github.com/cwoodall/scores/blob/main/mandolin/rock/rise/Rise.pdf) by [Eddie Vedder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWbiCr200N8) for violin and mandolin.

This is the mp3 version exported from musescore, a live version should be recorded some time soon!

I also spent some time wrapping up a few personal projects including getting the audio plugin I worked on last Christmas break up and running (see [Wahmbulance](https://github.com/cwoodall/audio-plugin-wahmbulance)). A write-up will be coming shortly!

#### Heading to Maine

Towards the end of August I headed to Island Falls, Maine where I spent a week with Emily's family. This was a week packed with:

- Cooking more of this amazing [silken tofu recipe](https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/chili-garlic-silken-tofu/)
- Learning ring toss
- Stand up paddling and canoeing
- Learning cribbage
- Hiking Katahdin via the Hunt Trail (AT)

| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
- Reading and finishing 3 books:
  - Ancillary Sword
  - Ancillary Mercy
  - Mistborn: Secret History
- Playing music with Emily's family
- Foraging for Chanterelle Mushrooms (and eating them)

| :----------------------------------------------------------------: |

## What's Next

I am starting a job as a Real-Time Controls Engineer at Commonwealth Fusion Systems. I will still be programming in C++ and Python, but my focus will be on control systems for Tokamak Operations. This is a change from my past roles which have all been explicitly in Embedded Software Engineering or Electrical Engineering. I have grown into a controls engineering role working at BETA implementing, tuning and designing motor controllers for PMSM motors. I am excited to continue to grow in this field and learn more about the physics and engineering of fusion reactors. 

I have been doing some arrangements for violin and mandolin and want to keep on doing that, and recording more music.

I want to have friends and family over routinely to have great conversations. I have found that even one evening chatting with friends is a remedy for so much stress and anxiety in my life.

I am planning on continuing investing time and energy into rock climbing. I have a few 5.10c/d projects on my list and want to bust through that barrier.

I want to continue to learn about mushrooms and foraging. I have found that be learning about mushrooms, and what to identify I am looking at the outdoors in completely new ways. Places I have gone many times to climb now have a whole ecology that is so interesting to learn about. I find it fun to see and identify things I have not seen before, and forage for the very limited set of mushrooms I know how to identify (Chanterelles); however this has been interesting to me.

I am planning on continuing to read, and write about what I read.

I have commitment to improving my health.

## Lessons Learnt

1. My anxiety is way reduced, my sleep is way better; however, this has I think less to do with work and more with a feeling of peace, hopefulness and a feeling of security about my place in the world. I think a key insight is to **get good sleep (8 hours as a target)**, and have strategies for coping with night time anxiety (reading, writing, meditation, etc.). For me night time yoga nidra meditations have been very useful.
2. I have a lot of energy, and I am excited to get back to work. I am excited to learn new things, and to be challenged in new ways. Keeping non-work projects, and focuses fresh seems to be a way to unlock a lot of energy. My work is important to me, but it is not mine in a lot of ways. We collaborate on work with our peers, having creative and athletic projects that allow you to grow that are self-driven is important for me to maintain a healthy amount of energy.
3. Weightloss doesn't come for free. I kept hoping that by changing circumstances with work my weight would start to decrease, and while the trend is down; just removing work did not reduce my weight. However, having a more active day to day life style and eating better food does help. Lasting change comes from lifestyle change and good habits not from massive shifts (most of the time).
4. Curiosity
5. Value growth over being
6. Planning is hard, and entering a mini-sabbatical without the fitness required to take on some of your bucket list items is hard. If I choose to take extended time off of work again I will likely do more work around choosing a few bigger objectives to hit and train for them; as well as, scheduling good time to relax, reset and reassess
7. Plan fun and exciting things all of the time. Most of the trips I went on would be possible to fit in during a work schedule in an abbreviated form. Just make the time to go and do the things that make you whole.
